- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Dart Sass (https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)

### What I learned

This was my first project using Sass so needless to say I've learned a lot. It's really helpful in keeping things clean and easy to maintain. I wouldn't say it saved time compared to vanilla CSS but for sure it seems like a must for large projects. I like how it helps keep things more organised.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing Sass and I look forward to learning a lot more about its capabilities.
